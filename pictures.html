            Money can’t buy happiness, but it can buy security and safety for you and your loved ones. Human beings need money to pay for all the things that make your life possible, such as shelter, food, healthcare bills, and a good education. You don’t necessarily need to be Bill Gates or have a lot of money to pay for these things, but you will need some money until the day you die. 
Because money is necessary for obtaining the goods and services you need to survive, an understanding of personal finance is essential. You need to be responsible with the money you earn and save enough for the future to ensure you will still have enough leftover when you can no longer trade your labor for money.

                The best time to start planning for your future is as early as possible.

            Many young people think about how to earn money to buy the things they want, but it is important to learn how to manage that money too! The best place to start is with a bank account. Once you land that new job, open a bank account to keep track of your money and keep it safe. The account will open the door for making better financial decisions and becoming more confident in money management.
